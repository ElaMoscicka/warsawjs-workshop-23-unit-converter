This project is based on the project from Workshop 22:

* https://github.com/rsp/warsawjs-workshop-22-unit-converter

During Workshop 22 we developed a project that converts
currencies using NBP exchange rates and temperature units
and we added several unit tests.

Special thanks to
**[Ela Mo≈õcicka](https://github.com/ElaMoscicka)** üèÖüèÜüåπ
for greatly improving the frontend appearance!
([PR #1](https://github.com/rsp/warsawjs-workshop-22-unit-converter/pull/1))

This time we will focus on end-to-end tests for this project
and we will add a few more features in the process.

Workshop 22 Tasks
=

Here are the original tasks from Workshop 22:

Temperature conversion
-

Temperatures need to be converted between
degrees Celsius, Fahrenheit and Kelvin.

You need to find the correct formulas and:

1. Add converter functions in the `converters` directory

2. Add tests in the `tests` directory

Currency conversion
-

Currencies need to be converted between
EUR, PLN and USD
using th eaverage NBP exchange rate as for the day 2018-01-02.

You need to find a way to connect to query the NBP API for the exchange rates and:

1. Add converter functions in the `converters` directory

2. Add tests in the `tests` directory

The API documentation is available on:

* http://api.nbp.pl/en.html

Continuous Integration
-

Configure one of the CI systems to run your tests automatically
and add correct build status badges to the README.

Workshop 23 Tasks
=

Here are the new tasks that we will focus on during this workshop:

End-to-end tests
-

* Add end-to-end tests that make sure that all required information is present

* Add end-to-end tests that make sure that all required text fields are present

* Add end-to-end tests that make sure that all required buttons are present

* Add end-to-end tests that make sure that clicking buttons result in populating appropriate fields

* Add end-to-end tests that make sure that clicking buttons give correct results

* Add end-to-end tests for the project using the same test strategy as the unit tests present in the project

* Add end-to-end tests that test that calcuation still work after clicking buttons many times

* Create failing end-to-end tests for nonexistent functionality of length conversion

* Make sure that you cover everything needed to make sure that the length conversion works correctly when implemented

* Implement the weight conversion to pass the tests

* Implement the length units conversion with no end-to-end tests

* Add end-to-end tests for the length units conversion after it is implemented

* Decide if you think it's better to start with tests or the implementation and implement a new conversion of your choice with end-to-end tests using the order that you prefer

Extra tasks
=

For anyone who finished early there are some additional tasks
in no particular order:

End-to-end tests
-

* Refactor the end-to-end tests in the Warmup project to cover all possible calculations:
  * https://github.com/rsp/warsawjs-workshop-23-warmup

* Refactor the implementation of the Warmup project to use a different UI and still pass the end-to-end tests

* Refactor the implementation of the Warmup project to use a different logic and still pass the end-to-end tests

Linter
-

* Make sure that all of the code complies with the linter with provided configuration or change the linter configuration for the style guide of your choice

Unit tests
-

* Add unit tests for the new features added during this workshop using the framewok of your choice
* Add unit tests using at least two different test frameworks
* Try to maximize the test coverage

Caching
-

* Make a request for every currency only once and cache the value in program memory

* Make a request for every currency only once and cache the value in Redis database

Dates
-

* Add functionality to select a specific date for the exchange rate

Frontend
-

* Make the frontend more convenient to use

* Add a simple chart for currency exchange rates using the `converter` functions

* Display a table of temperatures in degrees C, F and K computed using the `converter` functions

Deployment
-

* Deploy your application to Heroku

* Deploy your application to a VPS on Digital Ocean ([promo link](https://m.do.co/c/64b6b577b3de) for free 10 USD)

* Deploy your application to a VPS on Vultr ([promo link](https://www.vultr.com/?ref=7107329) for free 10 USD)
